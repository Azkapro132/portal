## Note

<p align=justify>This mod's (spriting) style won't work well with others because it doesn't. N</p>

<p align=justify>Currently, the mod is still in development (and yes, I said that too many times). Most of the contents are either <b>hidden</b> or <b>sandboxOnly</b>. You should make a custom map first in the <i>Editor</i> to put the tiles and everything. After that, you can go on to <i>Custom Map</i> to test out the contents. Feel free to leave suggestions in the Discord server.</p>

## Content List

```
Blocks

• Environment
  > Black Tile
    A non-portal conductor surface.
  > White Tile
    A portal conductor surface.
  > Squared Tile
    A portal conductor surface.
  > Acid
    Also known as the goo, hazard liquid, or toxic water. Providing penalty for your failure.
   
  
  *Note: The tile edges are still there, I'm currently trying to figure out the most efficient way possible to remove it.
  
• Power
  > Chamberlock Platform
    End current game, or test chamber.
  > Pedestal Button
    Outputs power for a while when something is on top of it.
  > Rectangular Heavy Duty Super Button
    Outputs power for as long as there's something above or on it.
  > Power Circle
    Transfers power to another power transferer or block that is next to it. Turns to yellow when power status is true.
  > Power Hollow
    Same with power circle, except it's now shaped like a ring. Usually placed in corners.
  > Power Transparent
    Same with the other power transferers, now it's transparent. Used when transferring power to an even number sized block.
  
• Producer
  > Storage Cube Launcher
    Block that launches weighted storage cube. Requires power to activate.
  > Companion Cube Launcher
    Block that launches weighted companion cube. Requires power to activate.
  > Sentry Deployer
    Deploys sentry turret unit.
  
• Storage
  > Elevator
    Allows test subjects to enter a test chamber. Works like a core in the normal game.
  
• Walls
  > Black Wall
    A non-portal conductor wall.
  > Large Black Wall
    A large version of the non-portal conductor wall.
  > White Wall
    A portal conductor wall.
  > Large White Wall
    A large version of the portal conductor wall.
  > Doorway
    Allows test subjects to travel between rooms in a test chamber. Requires power to open.
  
Units

• Ground Unit
  > Weighted Storage Cube
    A cube that can be moved around to accomplish stuff in a test chamber.
  > Weighted Companion Cube
    A modified version of the weighted storage cube. It has a pink heart this time.
  > Sentry Turret
    A sentry turret unit that shoots at test subject in it's prespective. It can't rotate or move. 
    
    *Note: For sentry, only use in the opposite team of the test subject, and it's not meant to be pushed around.
  
Items

• Liquids
  > Repulsion Gel
    A blue gel with an unknown use since jump boost doesn't make sense in this game mechanics.
  > Propulsion Gel
    An orange gel that gives speed boost to anything that's on it.
  > Conversion Gel
    Liquidified moon rocks that can turn your non-portal conductor surface to a portal conductor surface!
    
    *Note: These liquids are still in development, and portals are not here yet..
