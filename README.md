## How

<p align=justify>Currently, the mod is still in development (and yes I said that too many times). Most of the contents are either <b>hidden</b> or <b>sandboxOnly</b>. You should make a custom map first in the Editor to put the tiles and everything, and then edit in-game or in Sandbox to test contents that this mod have. Feel free to leave suggestions in the Discord server.</p>
